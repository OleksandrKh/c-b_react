At that moment I am working with this project. (Not finished yet)

Start it with:
* npm install
* npm start
* open http://localhost:8080/

Next steps:
* Texts for this site (using Mocha etc.)
* Server side on Node.js
* AJAX requests (to Node.js server) -> At that monent I import data.json to index.js and work with it
* Create pruduction version of this web-site and push it on GitHub
